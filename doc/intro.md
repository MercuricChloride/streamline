# Introduction to Streamline
Hey there!

Welcome to the Streamline docs!

If you don't care about explanations and just want to see some code, click [HERE](./grow-a-stream.md)

Streamline is a programming language built by your friends at Spyglass Labs with the fundamental goal of empowering it's users to interact with and use blockchain data in new and interesting ways that would have otherwise been highly time consuming, highly impractical, or just technically impossible.

Streamline is designed from the ground up to be the simplest and most expressive way to interact with blockchain data. It is built with first-class support for Ethereum concepts. So any solidity developer will feel right at home when working with it.

Although it is worth nothing, that at it's core, the language is not opinionated as you will see shortly. So extending and growing the language to work for another blockchain or usecase is trivial.

# Why did we build this?

You may be asking the question: "Why build a language for this?"

Or maybe: "Why should I use this? Tool XYZ works for me!"

## The short answer
The short answer is that I truly believe Streamline solves a big problem for blockchain data analytics. It is a tool that is simple to learn, and yet the language has features that allow the language to grow with the needs of it's user.
All while offering a set of tools for taming complexity that other tools don't offer. As such I think that it offers the best development experience and will save you or your company countless hours of suffering and despair.

If you still aren't sold, you can read my long answer [here](./why.md) for more context into the problem we are solving here. Otherwise if this all sounds good, you can move ahead to the next section!
