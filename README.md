# Streamline üèä 

_THIS LANGUAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT. THINGS MIGHT CHANGE OR BREAK UNTIL WE CUT A STABLE RELEASE_

A delightfully simple declarative, data driven programming language built for the EVM, specifically for developing and using Substreams in a more intuitive and powerful manner.

Check out the docs [HERE](doc/intro.md) to get started!

## Usage

#### NOTE I am adding a releases section here that will build the uberjar into a binary. I have it working locally, just need to wire up the actions! :)

    $ streamline [cmd] [opts]

## Examples

### Bugs / Features in progress

I'm sure there are lots of bugs waiting to be found. If you find something please let me know!

#### Features ready by ~~11/27/2023~~ 11/30/2023
1. ~~Store Modules (This is coming super soon)~~ DONE!
2. ~~Arbitrary Functions~~ DONE!
3. Modules w/ Param inputs
4. Helpers for bootstrapping and fetching abis for contracts. Think `streamline init`
5. Contract Instances
6. Sink Configs

_I pushed back the release of some of these features, as I spent a few days cleaning up and optimizing the code generation pathway. It makes building the repl much simpler. So that is only a few days of work away._

#### Features coming soon
1. Arbitrary substeams spkg interop
2. Live REPL for substreams development, without wasting your data. (We will offer a free endpoint to query raw block data from)
3. LSP and Editor Support for things other than emacs, since I already built that :)
4. Rust fn interop
